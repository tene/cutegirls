<Tene> Just had an interesting idea for a God's way of offering you a chance to avoid death penalties... challenges of some sort.
<Tene> You die, and you're transported to a small dungeon with your inventory scattered around carried by monsters, or hidden.
<Tene> (hopefully your sword of badassery is carried by the goblin this time, not the horrible chimera)
<Tene> At any time you can choose to walk out the door back to life, but if you don't go defeat J. Random Guardian, you lose a lot of XP.
<Tene> But if JRG kills you, you lose even more?
<Tene> Another idea just now is a God that lets you transform into some harmless/horrible/whatever other form when you're dead, but you need to travel to a temple to get it cured, or face degenerative consequences.
<Tene> "<global chat>Godammit, I'm a bunny again!  I need to gain more favor so I don't get a death form that's so worthless"
<Tene> Or a horribly powerful monster with a rapid degenaritive problem.
<rlpowell> All of those seem interesting.
<Tene> If you worship Odin with enough favor, you get to go hang out in Valhalla when you're dead.  Drink ale, eat pigs, and get advanced combat training.
<Tene> I'm really pleased with that one.
<rlpowell> *nod*
<rlpowell> In that case, though, you have to include Allah as a possible god, because I want *that* afterlife.
<rlpowell> (fucking virgins, specifically)
<rlpowell> I have no idea if the Qu'ran *actually* promises that, and of course you shouldn't *actually* have Allah in the game, beacues I would like to continue living.
<Tene> You don't want to gain favor with your god through suicide bombing a school bus of goblin children?
<Tene> ;)
<Tene> There was something similar in retromud... lemme find the link...

<rlpowell> http://www.freeratio.org/vbb/archive/index.php/t-63221.html -- apparently it really *does* indicate something like that.
<Tene> What would you as a player get out of your character getting that afterlife?
<rlpowell> Textual porn.  :D
<rlpowell> It would be *hella* fun to write a textual porn generator for various languages.
<Tene> Heh.
<Tene> That's... hilarious.
