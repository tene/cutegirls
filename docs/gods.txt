<Tene> I was thinking that in the roguelike I'm working on, one way to avoid or reduce penalties for death would be favor with a God.
<rlpowell> *nod*
<Tene> Might be annoying for people who aren't interested in obtaining favor with a god, though, so I should consider alternatives.
<rlpowell> Have a magical artifact that provides approximately the same benefits for approximately the same effort.
<Tene> Hmm.  Could be.
<rlpowell> FWIW, I think that "If you're stupid enough to walk around without having buffed your god favour to the point of having a couple of free guaranteed resurrects saved up, you deserve to die" would be a perfectly acceptable solution to permadeath for me.
<Tene> Ah, yes.  "Just be more careful"
<rlpowell> Also, please don't have hunger as a major game element; it sucks.
<Tene> Ew, yes.
<rlpowell> But it's a specific *kind* of careful.
<rlpowell> It's careful that can be built up in advance.
<rlpowell> You can be as retarded as you want as long as you pay for it by investing some time up front.
<rlpowell> I'm very bad at remembering to be careful whilst exploring, you see.
<Tene> Right.  Either find favor with a God or be careful while exploring.  Two alternative options.
<Tene> That's good enough for me.
<rlpowell> I'm a bit surprised that it's good enough for me, but it seems that it is.
<kpreid> The question is whether "be careful" is *possible*
<rlpowell> Where atheists get a protective amulet of yendalthog or whatever to serve the same function.  :)
<Tene> Well, the unprotected option isn't "permadeath", it's "stat loss, equipment loss, etc."
<rlpowell> kpreid: You mean the way it isn't in most roguelikes?
<Tene> I'm also quite interested in finding very different ways to gain favor and very different benefits for the different gods.
<kpreid> rlpowell: I don't know enough to generalize, but yes.
<rlpowell> *nod*
<rlpowell> (to both)
<kpreid> "Can you implement a God of Not Grinding?"
<Tene> From the basic "burn shit" god who likes people who burn shit and give them powers to burn more shit, to Eris.
<Tene> kpreid: I expect so.  The first idea is that once you have enough favor with some specific God, you no longer worry about various stats.
  rlpowell *so* wants to worship Burn Shit.
<Tene> Your "hit stuff" stat changes from a number to "yes"
<kpreid> Tene: heh
<Tene> rlpowell: you need to come up with a less obvious name for her, though.
<kpreid> Tene: have you got an "Intelligence" stat?
<rlpowell> Awwww....  But *why*?
<kpreid> la jelmaj
<kpreid> (not to be confused with la jelkalci)
<Tene> kpreid: I haven't decided on stats yet.  I'm considering copying from a friend's RPG system, which has {Physical,Practical,Social,Scholarly} Knowledge stats
<rlpowell> Tishnurb
<Tene> .u'i
<Tene> Heh.
<Broca> What on Earth are you discussing?
<rlpowell> Your doom!
<kpreid> Tene: Because if you do, then having it at "Yes" should let you see the whole floor layout as soon as you walk down, per Doc Smith.
<Tene> Doc Smith?
<kpreid> Lensman.
<Tene> rlpowell: I'm also entertained with coming up with behaviors for Eris.
<Tene> kpreid: also, was "God of Not Grinding?" a serious question?  Why was it in quotes?
<kpreid> Tene: I quote remarks by a hypothetical person. You can take it as a serious question if you like.
<Tene> Ah.
<kpreid> It's not entirely serious, and the hypothetical person might or might not know this, because it would be very difficult to design a system that does in fact resist grinding (in some form), though one might easily eliminate simpler forms
<Tene> The effort would be helped by the fact that the person who wants to worship such a god would also want to resist grinding.
<kpreid> I think you're mixing up player and character motivations.
<Tene> Oh, true.
<Tene> Player is likely more interested in less-grindy styles of gameplay, though, right?
<rlpowell> You would think.
<Tene> I'd want to design a God that offers a type of gameplay that is more interesting to players who are interested in less-grindy styles of gameplay.
  rlpowell likes a certain amount of grind, fwiw.
<Tene> I'd also imagine that with enough players it would be interesting for many Gods to offer such stats to a single person.
<Tene> Flammability: No.   Burning shit: yes.
<Tene> i also like a certain amount of Grind.
<Tene> Also, a certain type of race without stat or skill advancement might be interesting.
<kpreid> Tene: You are what you inventory?
<Tene> Could be.  You could forbid inventory for that race, too.
<kpreid> What's left? Your god's opinion of you?
<rlpowell> Luck?
<Tene> kpreid: player skill
<Tene> possibly
<Tene> I don't know.  I'll think about it.
<Tene> Also in this context, I'm entertained by the idea of having the judeo-christian God as an option.
<Tene> He would be pretty useless, it seems.
<rlpowell> A modern one would be.
<rlpowell> THe one that threw down the walls of Jericho is welcome to get my back any day of the week.
<Tene> Did the historic one actually claim to offer anybenefits to his followers?
<rlpowell> Erm.  *Yes*.
<rlpowell> That's the whole point of Job.
<Tene> That's only to high-level priests, though, right?
<rlpowell> No.
<rlpowell> If you were a good little Jew, you were guaranteed a nice life with lots of money and kids and so on.
<Tene> I thought that Job was pretty fucked overall, but the point was that he was still happy and had a good afterlife.
<rlpowell> Erm.
<rlpowell> Traditional Judaism doesn't *have* an afterlife.
<rlpowell> Only rewards in this one.
<rlpowell> That's why Job is so fucked up.
<rlpowell> (and why Jesus was such a big deal)
<Tene> So you'd get... money, luck, morale boosts...
<rlpowell> IANAJ, but I've talked to a few people about this over the years.
<rlpowell> And occasionally God destroying entire races of your enemies, if they were being naughty.
<Tene> Your duty would be to pray often and follow a strict set of rules?
<rlpowell> Sounds about right.
<rlpowell> No shrimp for you!
<Tene> Occasional intervention, I guess.
<Tene> Would be entertaining to have intervention be completely random. ;)
<Tene> Also interesting is how which Gods care about favor with which other Gods.
<rlpowell> Enh.  That's a different god.
<rlpowell> Almost, but not quite, Eris.
<Tene> I'd imagine Burn Shit wouldn't care at all who else you prayed to as long as you kept burning, but others might not approve of your relationship with Her.
<Tene> Eris is more about chaos and discord than randomness.
<rlpowell> Exactly.
<Tene> Eris would be another non-jealous god.
<rlpowell> I disagree wrt jealousy and Eris, fwiw.
<Tene> Oh?
<Tene> Please explain.
<rlpowell> Well, the whole golden apple thing was all *about* jealousy.
<rlpowell> Her being jealous at not being invited, and preying on others' jealousy in return.
<rlpowell> That's all.
<Tene> Oh.
<Tene> Right.
<Tene> iirc, the PD claims that she said that was all a misunderstanding.  I'll check.
<rlpowell> PD?
<Tene> Principia Discordia
<rlpowell> *OH*, you're talking about *that* Eris.
<rlpowell> I was talking about the historical one.
<rlpowell> They, umm, have some differences.  :)
<Tene> Rather.
<rlpowell> No, PD Eris would probably not be jealous.
<rlpowell> But it's been a *very* long while since I've read any Erisian philosophy.
<Tene> Yes, that's the Eris I find interesting here.
<rlpowell> *nod*
